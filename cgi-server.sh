cgi-server() {
  VERSION=0.1.0
  USAGE="cgi-server - ğŸ”Œ Connecting BASH to the web!

Usage:

  cgi-server run my-script.cgi

  cgi-server run my-script.cgi -p 8080

  cgi-server run my-script.cgi --port 8080 -h 0.0.0.0

  cgi-server run my-script.cgi --adapter ruby

  cgi-server run my-script.cgi --adapter uwsgi

  cgi-server run my-script.cgi --adapter [custom]

Default port: 8080

Default host: 127.0.0.1

To provide a [custom] adapter, there must be a defined
function named [custom]CgiAdapter which responds to
the following commands:

  myCgiAdapter start file.cgi     # must output server identifier, e.g. PID
                                  # and return 0 if server started successfully
                                  # else return non-zero with message in STDERR

  myCgiAdapter stop [identifier]  # the id returned by 'start' is used by 'stop'

All arguments (excluding --adapter xxx) will be passed to the adapter
including the raw -p/--port or -h/--host and all other arguments.

Your adapter is responsible for parsing and handling any provided arguments.
